"content": "Welcome to my humble plot of bits and pixels. The purpose of this site is to force me to think and build in public. I intend to cultivate three primary form factors of information here: words, ideas, and curations. Words will vary along a gradient of &#39;completeness&#39; - less structured musings of various lengths on one end and more refined essays on the other. Ideas could be one sentence, a pitch, or a prototype. Some ideas should convert to words. Others should manifest in a venture. Many should die. All should be capture in some way. Curations are living lists of embodied quality within a given domain. Their purpose is threefold: to collect them for my own reference, to share with others interested, and as a hat tip to the creators. This effort is born out of a longing to bring order to the chaos of an unstructured mind and required overcoming inertial resistance to starting somewhere. It will be a work in progress for some time, and will be successful if anyone derives any measure of value from it. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; .",

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later. Images . From what I understood, Jekyll doesn&#39;t support source files inside collection folders like _notes. Currently, what I do is, I upload images and attachments manually to /assets/img/ and use . From Assets/Img ![Alt Text](/assets/img/1-how-to.png &quot;Title Here&quot;) . to embed images. This is not effective, but works. Also, public URLs work . From URL ![](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png) . From Assets/Img . From URL . Code and Syntax Highlighting . Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn&#39;t. However, many renderers â€“ like Github&#39;s and Markdown Here â€“ support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks â€“ they&#39;re easier and only they support syntax highlighting. ```javascript var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;; alert(s); ``` ```python s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot; print s ``` ``` No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let&#39;s throw in a tag. ``` . var s = &quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;; alert(s); . s = &quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot; print s . No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let&#39;s throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;. Math expressions . You can write math expressions using the \\LateX\\LateX\\LateX markup language between double dollar signs : $$â€¦$$. They can be written inline or as a single block. For example, . | $$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$ will render as : | . P(Aâˆ£B)=P(Bâˆ£A)â‹…P(A)P(B)P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B | A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}P(Aâˆ£B)=P(B)P(Bâˆ£A)â‹…P(A)â€‹ | Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character | may conflict with markdown : it is recommended to use \\vert instead. | . Tables . Tables aren&#39;t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email â€“ a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application. Colons can be used to align columns. | Tables | Are | Cool | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 | col 2 is | centered | $12 | zebra stripes | are neat | $1 | There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don&#39;t need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown. Markdown | Less | Pretty --- | --- | --- *Still* | `renders` | **nicely** 1 | 2 | 3 .

Blockquotes . &amp;gt; Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. &amp;gt; This line is part of the same quote. Quote break. &amp;gt; This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let&#39;s keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone.

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it&#39;ll mostly work pretty well. &amp;lt;dl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;Definition list&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;Is something people use sometimes.&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;Markdown in HTML&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;Does *not* work **very** well.

Three or moreâ€¦ . Hyphens . Asterisks . Underscores . Line Breaks . My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover â€“ hit once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You&#39;ll soon learn to get what you want. &quot;Markdown Toggle&quot; is your friend. Here are some things to try out: . Here&#39;s a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it&#39;s a separate line in the *same paragraph*. Here&#39;s a line for us to start with.
