In recent roles, I have been in the position of trying to convert research into product. Applying novel research to hard practical applications is an equally exciting and challenging space to operate in. There are a few principles I have observed and tried to learn along the way.

**1. Research is inherently unpredictable**

When given an open-ended question to answer or problem to solve within a technical domain, it is challenging to know which approach, if any, will work. Research being based on experimentation leads to it being challenging to plan around. Traditional engineering organizations revolve around rythms and frameworks of planning, developing, testing, releasing, monitoring, and repeating. Injecting unpredictable research into these processes can lead to a mismatch in process. Attempting to estimate research outcomes on short, concrete timelines is the wrong approach. It is more useful to set conditions at certain milestones for when to continue a research thread, or when to re-evaluate the conviction in pursuing it based on results to date. It's easy to run the risks of either having an open-ended thread running without a timebox to evaluate it, or to give a project too little time to reach fruition. Avoid both. Embrace the unpredictability and follow what works.

**2. Research is challenging to monetize**

Know what resources you are working with, and what expectations your funders or sponsors have for monetization, and on what timeline. Applied research needs serious up front thought about what practical, eventually profitable, products will emerge, and then development towards those targets in parallel. This not only helps steer and constrain the research ambition, but provides a vision to help justify the initial cost. As a project goes from idea to experimentation to successful proof of concept, there is a wide chasm between the demo working and a viable, sustainable, hardened, and ideally profitble product existing. Misalignment between the research team and stakeholders depending on its output, whether revenue or product, can induce suboptimal friction. Strike the balance between uncertain but potentially high return efforts in the long run and sufficient backing and patience from short run revenue generation pressure. Chasing short term metrics is at odds with a mandate to genuinely place ambitious bets.

I saw this misalignment in directionality at Twitter. Product and engineering executives mandated that all algorithmic research work be in service to making the Twitter user experience more personalized and lucrative. The applied AI research org where I worked had existing bets across technical domains like graph machine learning and content understanding that were uniquely suited to be studied in an environment like Twitter that were prematurely shelved before realizing the ambition of what they were studying as it was at odds with the quarter over quarter revenue and user growth targets.

**3. Research is hard to measure**

Quantifying the impact of research is inherently challenging, and depends on what an effort is optimizing for. What is the endstate you are seeking and what is the scale of your ambition? Are you incrementally improving the existing tech at the margin or seeking to create a net new thing from scratch? Answer these questions a priori, and ensure your stakeholders are aligned on them within the environment you operate in.

Is the research effort aiming to fundamentally discover new properties and advance the frontier of knowledge in a given field? Take goals around peer-reviewed publications and conference acceptances. Is the research effort laddering up to a broader product or revenue goal? Take goals around improving results of A/B tests against a control sample of no research support, which can be difficult to instrument and prove a counterfactural. At Twitter, experiments were tested against a fractional portion of production traffic and ship decisions were made on the basis of whether a treatment sample increased the canonical metrics of daily active users or projected revenue. There is a choice to be made around how to measure research progress and contributions whether organically within the goals of a research project or externally in terms of contributions to a broader effort. The optimal balance is a combination of both.

**4. Figure out the right team composition**

There isn't a universal formula for the right team size and structure, which is certainly situation dependent. In general, keep the team small enough to be nimble but to produce results. Avoid growing large enough to induce coordination overhead between researchers. Keep a healthy balance of supporting infrastructure and personas like engineers who can integrate research products into core infrastructure layers and interface with the rest of the organization. Ensure that adjacent research efforts are close enough within a given domain to have complementary returns to scale and to allow researchers within the team to share learnings horizontally. Given the relative expense of domain expertise, ensure a proper balance of headcount and output depending on the time horizon and monetization pressure. Hire for more than just academic talent or domain expertise. Find specialists who can generalize when called upon to rather than narrowly focused people wearing blinders to anything outside their domain.

**5. Set up a good operating model in the company**

The relationships of the research team within the broader company, formally and informally, are critical to its longevity within the organization and the adoption of its outputs. Avoid the research group existing in an ivory tower. Also avoid the research team being pulled excessively into functions that can scale better when served by other personas like customer support or quality engineering. The optimal balance lies somewhere in between. Be flexible and depending on the needs of the company at any given time, find an operating model that works for a given outcome you are pursuing. Some setups I have observed work well in practice is embedding researchers on a product team to augment a team by injecting new tech in a product feature or forming task organized virtual teams around a given problem set. Overall, be humble and be good neighbors within an organization.

**6. Research has unique needs in a company**

Research needs time and some degree of insulation from traditional software timelines and economics to truly produce net new breakthroughs. Researchers need a balance of freedom to create and experiment, but also directional alignment of output to broader organizational goals. Research can be a beautiful thing and produce flourishing step function increase results, but needs to be protected to have longevity and to ultimately bear fruit. The best path I've learned for discovery and value creation is trying a lot of things you have a degree of conviction in working in parallel, iterate on what works, fail fast on what doesn't, and incrementally move the needle taking wins where you can.
