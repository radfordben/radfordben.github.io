*I have, once again, managed to squeak across the finish line of another annual reading goal. I afforded myself the ability to count both physical and audio books this year, so 'reading' is interpreted liberally as inclusive of multiple modalities of input. I am overall pleased with the majority of what I selected. On the whole, my body of reading this year was wide ranging and optimized for quality over quantity. Read on for takeaways and context on specific titles.*&#x20;

1.  **"Skunk Works" by Leo Janos and Ben R. Rich**  - My work at the intersection of new product development and defense technology led me to pick this up and learn why "Skunk Works" came to be synonymous with secretive, advanced, important tech. This was an interesting glimpse into the history of Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs. The book highlighted what it takes (a relentless pursuit of excellence, exacting standards, diplomacy) to push the engineering and political envelope and get things done, and many of the dynamics recounted with similar projects would be familiar today.&#x20;
2.  **"Places and Names" by Elliot Ackerman** - This memoir from an author and Marine I have immensely respected for years is a profound exploration of the personal cost of conflict.&#x20;
3.  **"Endure" by Alex Hutchinson -** An interesting look into the brain vs brawn debate on athletic performance and basically concluding that psychology can trump physiology in coaxing the body to achieve more.&#x20;
4.  **"The Brothers Karamazov" by Fyodor Dostoevsky -**  Each year, I make it a goal to attempt at least one classic of world literature. My first take of TBK, but not of Dostoevsky, was by far the most compelling and memorable read this year. The Grand Inquisitor episode in particular is among the most striking segment of literature I have read. The story as a whole is beautifully woven together, while subliminally making you wrestle with differing portrayals of the idea of what happiness is derived from, accountability, free will, family tensions.&#x20;
5.  **"Trust" by Hernan Diaz** - I came across this at the recommendation of a Financial Times list and read it in an afternoon in a hammock in Sayulita, Mexico. It was a fascinating novel with a well-executed take on telling a story through different timeframes and character sets.&#x20;
6.  **"Exhalation" by Ted Chiang** - I am not well versed in sci-fi, but have found Chiang's collections of short stories to be both approachable entrypoints into the genre and thoughtful vehicles to exploring fundamental moral questions about technology. In this collection, the most memoralbe were on the ethics of time travel, fragile ecosystems, and free will. Reflecting on it now, the depiction of an ecosystem as a symbiotic lung sustaining many lifeforms was so richly resonant in a few pages and is among the top short stories I've read.&#x20;
7.  **"The Garden of Eden" by Ernest Hemingway** - When traveling, I make an attempt to bring literature either written by the sons and daughters of the place or set in the place. I brought this lesser known Hemingway (apparently his widow found the manuscript on his desk after his death and took it to the publisher in a shopping bag!) title on vacation to the south of France this summer . I didn't expect much, and frankly was at a time when I just needed an easy mindless read, and was pleasantly surprised. At once provocative and numbingly pleasant, Hemingway charts transformations of two protagonists who end up destroying each other and what each loves.&#x20;
8.  **"Greenlights" by Matthew McConaughey** - Greenlights was the book that most surprised me this year with its quality. I had seen this book in airport bookshop windows and promoted in various places, and therefore wrote it off as another celebrity shilling a ghostwritten faux memoir - literally judging a book by its cover. I was flat out wrong. I listened to this book while traveling and was instantly hooked not only by the alluring Texas drawl and seasoned raconteur, but by how McConaughey told his stories and importantly what to take away from them. The book is the genuine work of a student of life and his craft, told with a self-deprecating lightness and an endearing pride.&#x20;
9.  **"A Year in Provence" by Peter Mayle** - I'm surprised this book has had the staying power it has since its publication. I read it in anticipation of traveling to the south of France, yet it failed to draw my attention and I muddled through it.&#x20;
10. **"Finite and Infinite Games" by James P. Carse** - This was a powerfully compact framework that provides a useful heuristic for evaluating and optimizing one's pursuits in life. Finite games are played to be won and are time-bound and rules bound (e.g. sports) . Infinite games are played *for the purpose of continuing to play them* (e.g. relationships)*.* They are for open-ended creativity to find the means to perpetuate them. The two can be thought of as short term and long term focused, and Carse argues we can apply the wrong tactics to the wrong game by not considering which we're in. As someone who is both quite competitive and outcome focused, my main takeaway was reframing how to approach the concept of infinite games with a different playbook than I tackle other more ephemeral pursuits. &#x20;
11. **"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" by Richard P. Feynman** - I read Feynman this summer during the fleeting American infatuation with physicists brought about by Christopher Nolan's excellent *Oppenheimer* film. I found the book to be a charming and disarmingly genuine set of stories capturing a deeply intellectually curious and brilliant mind.
12. **"A Farewell to Arms" by Ernest Hemingway** - My brother traveled to South Africa with a group of friends this summer and asked for recommendations for what to read on the long flight. In my own brief travels to the continent several years ago, I enjoyed Hemingway's *Green Hills of Africa* and *Snows of Kilimanjaro* and recommended them to him. He fell in love with Hemingway and we decided we'd read everything he wrote together, with *Farewell* being the first pick. I last read *Farewell* when I was leaving active duty military service a few years ago, and revisiting it a bit removed from that timeframe was lovely and refreshing. The way he captures both the futility of conflict, and his characters' fated attempts to endure are raw and efficiently conveyed. I appreciate that Hemingway's characters are bluntly honest and stoically accepting of their nature and fates.&#x20;
13. **"Elon Musk" by Walter Isaacson** - I enjoyed the fruits of Isaacson's study of Musk for his skill as a biographer. I don't know if I learned anything new about Musk's public persona here. The most memorable moments came from learning about the troubles encountered in his childhood, pivotal decisions at early Tesla and SpaceX, and on a counterintuitive but principled approach to decision-making that is starkly contrarian, but which has proven durable and right in high stakes moments for businesses, products, and society.&#x20;
14. **"The Old Man and The Sea" by Ernest Hemingway** - This never gets old, and it had been many years since I last read it. I just love the raw conflict when dream confronts reality and the dogged physical and mental persistence embodied. His opening and closing device of the old man *dreaming of the lions on the beach* is so memorable.&#x20;
15. **"Slow Road to Tehran" by Rebecca Lowe** - Interesting book I had seen come out in the UK awhile back and mentally earmarked to pick up when available in the US. The author cycled from London to Tehran, a feat one would be remiss *not* to write a book about. The prose was about as tough to endure as the ride itself.&#x20;
16. **"The Sun Also Rises" by Ernest Hemingway** - Another Hemingway classic revisited. Last time I read it was on deployment at an obscure air base in southern Spain about an hour outside of Sevilla. Hemingway, surely through deep hands on research and experience, has a knack for capturing the vitality of both a bender and honest respect for an obscure sport like bullfighting.&#x20;
17. **"How to Know A Person" by David Brooks** - Second only this year to *Greenlights* in books I entered with reserved skepticism, then emerged hooked and recommending to others. I respect Brooks' cannon and have followed it from *The Social Animal* to *The Road to Character*, the *Second Mountain*, and now this which seem to build upon each other and explore his model ideal of selflessness as self-actualization. This book was filled with practical advice on just how to connect on a human basis with other members of our communities. Brooks included a heart-wrenching chapter on his close friend's struggle and ultimate fall to suicide, which is the deepest and clearest description of depression and its dark grip on a mind and life as I've ever read. &#x20;
18. **"Going Infinite" by Michael Lewis** - I like when Lewis decides to take on a topic. I was moderately interested in crypto in a technical curiosity sense during the last wave, but didn't really know the SBF or FTX story so decided to pick this one up. The story needed to be told as a cautionary tale of wild excess, and Lewis did so adequately. When financial wrongdoing on this colossal scale occurs, I more appreciate a deep detailed dive into the mechanics a la Sorkin's *Too Big to Fail* but in this case the personalities made for a more approachable entrypoint for the masses. For a shorter, more damning take, read Stephen Diehl's [*SBF is Crypto Personified.*](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/personified.html)
19. **"Ulysses" by James Joyce -** I took a few weeks of parental leave at the end of this year after the birth of our second daughter. When I was on leave with our first a few years ago, I read (and loved) *War and Peace.* The newborn was less captivated with Tolstoy's epic than I was. I decided to take on Ulysses this go round, mostly due to having heard about it as a best novel of the century and also for a particular enjoyment of the Odyssey. Ulysses was frankly tough to get through. I wouldn't have been able to follow the arc without the companion ulyssesguide.com. Once I was oriented on what was happening, I was able to parse a bit better what was going on. Overall, I suppose its a literary feat but was tough for me to wade through and appreciate. Keeping the hours of a newborn may have contributed to this assessment.&#x20;
20. **"How Big Things Get Done" by Bent Flyvbjerg, Dan Gardner** - I saw this on a few of the business papers' lists and picked it up. Well researched, approachable, with a straightforward argument. A great and relatable take on how big projects go awry and fail often, and how to avoid common pitfalls.&#x20;

Aside from books, I read a \_lot\_ of content on X. In terms of traditional media, my dailies were the Financial Times, WSJ, and NYT. In terms of long form, I discovered [Palladium](https://www.palladiummag.com/) this year and found myself reading it periodically alongside the New Yorker and American Affairs Journal. The top newsletters I consumed - Ahead of AI, The Diff, Jack Clark, Marginalian by Maria Popova, Pirate Wires by Mic Solana. In print, I discovered [Drift](https://www.driftmag.com/) on coffee and [Mountain Gazette](https://mountaingazette.com/). &#x20;
