Welcome to my humble plot of bits and pixels. 

The purpose of this site is to force me to think and build in public.&#x20;

I intend to cultivate three primary form factors of information here: *words*, *ideas*, and *curations*.&#x20;

**[Words](/words)** will vary along a gradient of 'completeness' - less structured musings of various lengths on one end and more refined essays on the other.&#x20;

**[Ideas](/ideas)** could be one sentence, a pitch, or a prototype. Some ideas should [convert to words](https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html). Others should manifest in a venture. Many should die. All should be capture in some way.&#x20;

**[Curations](/curations)** are living lists of embodied quality within a given domain. Their purpose is threefold: to collect them for my own reference, to share with others interested, and as a hat tip to the creators.&#x20;

This effort is born out of a longing to bring order to the chaos of an unstructured mind and required overcoming inertial resistance to starting somewhere. 

It will be a work in progress for some time, and will be successful if anyone derives any measure of value from it.&#x20;
